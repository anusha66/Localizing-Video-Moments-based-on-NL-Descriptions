BiDNNs are similar to (or a variation of) multimodal autoencoders. They offer crossmodal translation and superior multimodal embedding created in a common representation created by the two crossmodal translation. The following picture illustrates the architectural differences of classical multimodal autoencoders and BiDNNs:

Multimodal Autoencoders
-----------------------

Classical multimodal autoencoders usually come in two varieties: i) standard autoencoders that are used in a multimodal setup by contactenating the modalities and ii) multimodal autoencoders that have separate layers for each modality and one or more central fully connected layers that yield a multimodal representation and serve as a translation layer (as illustrated in the left (*a*) part of the previous figure). One modality is often sporadically removed (zeroed) while a reconstruction of both modalities is expected at its output to force the multimodal autoencoder to represent one modality from the other.

Autoencoders however have some downsides which slightly deteriorate performance:
* Both modalities influence the same central layer(s), either directly or indirectly, through other modality-specific fully connected layers. Even when translating from one modality to the other, the input modality is either mixed with the other or with a zeroed input.
* Autoencoders need to learn to reconstruct the same output both when one modality is marked missing (e.g., zeroed) and when both modalities are presented as input.
* Classical autoencoders are primarily made for multimodal embedding while crossmodal translation is offered as a secondary function.

Bidirectional (Symmetrical) Deep Neural Networks
------------------------------------------------

In bidirectional deep neural networks, learning is performed in both directions: one modality is presented as an input and the other as the expected output while at the same time the second one is presented as input and the first one as expected output. This is equivalent to using two separate deep neural networks and tying them (sharing specific weight variables) to make them symmetrical, as illustrated in the right part of the previous figure (*b*). Implementation-wise the variables representing the weights are shared across the two networks and are in fact the same variables. Learning of the two crossmodal mappings is then performed simultaneously and they are forced to be as close as possible to each other's inverses by the symmetric architecture in the middle. A joint representation in the middle of the two crossmodal mappings is also formed while learning.

Given such an architecture, crossmodal translation is done straightforwardly by presenting the first modality and obtaining the output in the representation space of the second modality. Multimodal embeddings are obtained in the following manner:
* When the two modalities are available, both are presented at their respective inputs and the activations are propagated through the network. The multimodal embedding is then obtained by concatenating the outputs of the middle layer.
* When one modality is available and the other is not, the available modality is presented to its respective input of the network and the activations are propagated. The central layer is then used to generate an embedding by being duplicated, thus still generating an embedding of the same size while allowing to transparently compare video segments regardless of modality availability.

                        current epoch

```

For example, to obtain a multimodal embedding of two modalities (e.g. text with dimensionality 100 and CNN visual features or dimensionality 4096) stored in a *dataset.txt*, the command could be:
```
./bidnn.py -n -e 10000 dataset.txt output.txt 100 4096 2048 2048
```
This would train a BiDNN with the first hidden layer with 2048 nodes and a representation size of 2048 (the 2nd and central hidden layer would be of size 2014 for each crossmodal translation).

To do the same but store the model, generate a prediction and run an external evaluation tool every 100 epochs, the command would be the following:
```
./bidnn.py dataset.txt output_%e.txt 100 4096 2048 2048 -n -e 10000 -w 100 -s model_%e.npz -x "./evaulate.py output_%e.txt"
```
####Input format
Input and output files are stored in LibSVM format:
```
0 1:val1 2:val2 3:val3, ... n:valn
```
The first number is a label (since this is unsupervised learning, it's ignored but it's still preserved in case the user is doing unsupervised learning with label data and needs the labeled preserved). Following are i:val pairs indicating each nonzero float value of the vectors representing each modality. If the two modalities are e.g. of dimensionality 100 and 300, each line would consist of 400 entries, first of the first modality, followed by the second modality (as defined in the mod1size and mod2size command line arguments).

As a Python module
-------------------
```python
from biddn import BiDNN, Config

conf = Config()
conf.mod1size = 100
conf.mod2size = 4096
conf.hdn = 2048
conf.rep = 2048

X = ... # load or generate data

bidnn = BiDNN(conf)
bidnn.load_dataset(X)

bidnn.train()
out = bidnn.predict()
```
Fore more details, you can take a look at the *\__main\__* section of *bidnn.py*.
